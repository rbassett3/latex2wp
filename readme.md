# latex2wp

This is the source code for the LaTeX2WP project written by Luca Trevisan. I'm posting it on github because I made some modifications to convert it to Python 3, and I hope that someone finds these changes useful.

More information on the project can be found at Luca's [blog](https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/latex-to-wordpress/).

More information on how to use LaTeX2WP can be found in this repo's readme.txt.
